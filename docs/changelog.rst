This project uses `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ to
track version numbers, where backwards incompatible changes
(highlighted in **bold**) bump the major version of the package.

----------------------------------------------

.. THANKS FOR CONTRIBUTING; MENTION WHAT YOU DID IN THIS SECTION HERE!

2.0.1
-----

 * Fix an issue with the name of the scikit-learn dependency (#141, thanks @theconor, @Parth-1612 and @sadams-evi)
 * Fix a typo in the docs (#140, thanks @hilaryp)


2.0.0
-----

There have been some changes in the scrubadub API, but few breaking changes.
The headline changes include:

* Several new detectors have been added (spacy, stanford NER, tax reference number, credit card, ...).
* Splitting of the scrubadub package into smaller parts.
* Added ability to easily evaluate a ``Detector``\ 's performance, see :ref:`accuracy`.
* Started to localise detectors to function for more than one language/location.
* Support for scrubbing multiple documents together.
* Introduced the concept of a ``PostProcessor``.
  This will allow more complex groupings of ``Filth``\ s and new types of tokenization.
* New detector configuration/management system.

Scrubber
^^^^^^^^

* ``Detector``\ s and ``PostProcessor``\ s can be added and removed using a string containing their default name, their class or an instance.
* You can clean multiple documents with one ``Scrubber().clean_documents(docs)`` call
* **A default set of Detectors are loaded instead of all Detectors.**
  This is particularly useful for detectors that are slow or have complex dependencies, as they dont need to be loaded each time.
  However, this might need an explicit ``Scrubber().add_detector(detector)`` call for the same behaviour as before.
* Added a ``locale`` parameter to the ``Scrubber`` initialiser.
* A ``Scrubber`` will only auto-load detectors that support a given ``Scrubber`` ``locale``.
* The ``Scrubber`` will ensure that filth are valid with a call to ``Filth().is_valid()``

Detectors
^^^^^^^^^

* The the name of the detector has been separated from the type of filth found.
  This means multiple instances of the same detector (configured differently) can be in the same ``Scrubber`` instance and one ``Detector`` can return multiple types of ``Filth``.
* **Detectors now required to define an attribute called name**, which should be unique within a ``Scrubber`` instance.
* **Detectors are now passed a locale argument to the Detector initialiser**.
* ``Detectors`` have an optional ``supported_locale(locale)`` function that returns a bool to indicate if a given ``Detector`` supports a `locale`.
* **Regular expressions used by the RegexDetector class have been moved from RegexFilth.regex to RegexDetector.regex**.
* **Renamed SSNDetector to SocialSecurityNumberDetector**.
* New ``AddressDetector``, which detects US, CA and GB addresses.
* New ``CreditCardDetector``, which detects credit card numbers (based on the Detector in the `alphagov scrubadub fork <https://github.com/alphagov/scrubadub>`_).
* New ``DateOfBirthDetector``, which detects dates of birth (thanks to `@mirandachong <https://github.com/mirandachong>`_).
* New ``DriversLicenceDetector``, which detects GB drivers licence numbers.
* New ``TaggedEvaluationFilthDetector``, which is used to tag real filth in text when you're evaluating the quality of your filth removal.
* New ``UserSuppliedFilthDetector``, which is used to find bits of Filth that you know will be in the text.
* New ``PostalCodeDetector``, which detects GB post codes.
* New ``SpacyEntityDetector``, which detects a `range of named entities <https://spacy.io/api/annotation#named-entities>`_, including names (thanks to `@aCampello <https://github.com/aCampello>`_).
* New ``StanfordEntityDetector``, which also detects `slightly different range of named entities <https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html#Models>`_, including names.
* New ``NationalInsuranceNumberDetector``, which detects GB National Insurance Numbers (NINO) (thanks to `@mirandachong <https://github.com/mirandachong>`_).
* New ``TaxReferenceNumberDetector``, which detects GB Tax Reference Numbers (TRN) (thanks to `@mirandachong <https://github.com/mirandachong>`_).
* New ``VehicleLicencePlateDetector``, which detects number plates on GB cars (based on the Detector in the `alphagov scrubadub fork <https://github.com/alphagov/scrubadub>`_).
* New ``RegionLocalisedRegexDetector``, which derived from the convenience class ``RegexDetector`` to allow for quickly creating regional regex based detectors.
* ``Detector``\ s can now be registered to a catalogue of ``Detector``\ s.
  This allows detectors to be defined in separate packages.

Filth
^^^^^

* **Introduced three parameters in the constructor detector_name, document_name and locale**.
  These keep track of the ``Detector`` that found the ``Filth``, the document it came from and the documents locale.
  This results in ``Filth`` objects being passed additional parameters on initialisation.
  If you have defined custom ``Filth``\ s they will need to be updated so that ``Filth.__init__`` accepts the ``detector_name``, ``document_name`` and ``locale`` keywords and call the base class constructor.
* Added a ``generate()`` function that allows to generate fake examples of that ``Filth``.
  This can be used to help evaluate detector performance.
* Added an ``is_valid()`` function, this can be used to ensure that a piece of detected filth is indeed valid.

PostProcessors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Introduction of simple ``PostProcessors``:
   * ``FilthReplacer``: Replace the filth with the type of filth ``example@example.com -> EMAIL``, a configurable hash ``example@example.com -> 196aa39e9f8159ec`` or a monotonically increasing number for each unique piece of filth (optionally including the filth type) ``example@example.com -> EMAIL-1``.
   * ``PrefixSuffixReplacer``: Add a prefix and/or suffix onto the replacement ``EMAIL-1 -> {{EMAIL-1}}``
* It is envisioned that other more complex operations can be done here too such as grouping filth (e.g. "John", "John Doe" and "Mr. Doe" could be grouped together).
